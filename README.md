# Angular-Weather-App

#Overview
I built a SPA Weather App. Right when you arrive on the screen you are greeted with a search bar. Enter the city you want
weather information on into the search bar. Then it Instantly takes you to the next page where you can select 3,6,9 or 12
to show that amount of days.
